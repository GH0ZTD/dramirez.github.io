My top 3 favorite labs

My number 1 favorite lab was lab 12 its because I liked the finished product of part 1, the gradient colorshifting gif was really cool looking, and I had a blast with my partners.

My second favorite lab was lab 11 because i got to work with 2 other people, they were really fun with and the assignment got done

My third and final lab that I really liked was the one where we worked on the parking for the streets, I am fogetting the specific lab number at the moment, but I really had fun with this one and with my partner as well

this was all i could come up with at the moment for the 3 labs but yeah, overall they were fun.
